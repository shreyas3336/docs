They delegate their staked assets to trusted operators, thereby supporting network infrastructure while earning rewards for their participation. Delegators play a vital role in decentralizing the network by distributing stake among various operators.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Operator Selection:** Delegators carefully choose reputable Operators based on performance metrics, reliability, and trustworthiness.
*   **Stake Delegation:** They allocate their assets to selected Operators, thereby enhancing the Operators' capacity to manage more tasks and secure the network.
*   **Governance Participation:** Delegators engage in voting processes, influencing decisions on network policies, upgrades, and other governance matters.

**Importance in the Network:**

Delegation lowers the barrier to entry for those who wish to support decentralized infrastructure without managing technical operations. Through their contributions, Delegators enhance the network’s economic security, allowing it to scale while maintaining decentralization and resilience.
