Their primary objective is to ensure that all computations meet the network’s predefined standards for accuracy and reliability. This process strengthens trust and prevents tampering or dishonesty within the network.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Validation Process:** Upon receiving the Proof of Task and associated results from a Performer Node, Attestor Nodes independently verify the accuracy and legitimacy of the execution.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** Attestor Nodes participate in a consensus protocol, where they cast votes on the validity of each task. A task is approved if a supermajority (typically two-thirds) of Attestor Nodes confirm its validity.
*   **Enforcement of Penalties:** If a significant portion of Attestor Nodes (e.g., more than one-third) deems a task invalid, the network enforces penalties, such as slashing, against the responsible Performer Node to uphold network integrity.

**Importance in the Network:**

By validating tasks, Attestor Nodes ensure that only accurate and trustworthy computations are accepted, preventing fraudulent or erroneous outputs. Their role is essential for maintaining the network's credibility and ensuring that users can trust the results produced by the Capx Cloud.
