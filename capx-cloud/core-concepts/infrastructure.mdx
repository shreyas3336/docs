## Component Overview

### 1. User

The individual or team responsible for initiating development by providing or generating source code and interacting with the platform to deploy, test, and iterate on agentic systems.

### 2. AI Generated Code / Custom Code

The foundational logic used to create and define Services, MCP Servers, and AI Agents, encompassing both custom-written and AI-generated implementations.

### 3. Services

General-purpose modules such as APIs, user interfaces, backend logic, data processors, scrapers, indexers, inference wrappers, or cryptographic tools. These provide reusable, foundational functionalities utilized independently or by MCP Servers and AI Agents.

### 4. MCP Servers (Model Context Protocol Servers)

Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol. They act as gateways to data sources, handling authentication, data retrieval, and formatting, enabling AI applications to access external data in a standardized manner .

### 5. AI Agents

Autonomous, intelligent entities backed by Large Language Models (LLMs), capable of reasoning, responding to events, automating tasks (e.g., chatbots, auto-traders), and coordinating in multi-agent systems. They perform complex, intelligent, or interactive tasks, acting as the active logic or "brain" within the platform.

### 6. Deploy + Run Agentic Systems

The overarching environment responsible for deploying and operating all components (Services, MCP Servers, AI Agents).

### 7. Sandbox Deployment

A controlled, secure, and isolated environment facilitating the deployment of components for iterative testing and refinement before production deployment.

### 8. Execution Sandbox

A secure, isolated runtime environment that ensures secure execution and maintains state/data persistence, crucial for testing stateful applications and iterative development. It also provides diagnostic data for debugging, performance monitoring, and iterative improvements.

### 9. Feedback / Logs

Diagnostic outputs from the Execution Sandbox, essential for developers to understand system behavior, identify issues, and inform iterative improvements.

### 10. Iterate

The cyclical process of refining components based on feedback, logs, and insights from previous deployments until satisfactory outcomes are achieved.

### 11. Security Coach

An integrated security tool that performs real-time threat modeling, analyzing sandboxed applications for potential vulnerabilities, thereby proactively enhancing the system's security.
