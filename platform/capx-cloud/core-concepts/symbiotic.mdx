To support the economic backbone of this decentralized ecosystem, **Capx Cloud integrates with [Symbiotic](https://symbiotic.fi)-a shared security protocol designed to provide flexible (re)staking infrastructure**. Symbiotic simplifies the sourcing of economic security for networks like Capx Cloud by offering a framework where operators and stakers can commit collateral to multiple networks at once, thereby increasing overall capital efficiency.

At its core, Symbiotic streamlines the process of operator registration, stake management, and slashing adjudication. Instead of custom solutions for each network, **Symbiotic presents a universal, permissionless layer where participants can freely allocate capital, register as operators, and interact with multiple networks in parallel.**

* **(Re)Staking Infrastructure**: Symbiotic supports repurposing of staked assets (e.g., from Ethereum validators) for additional use cases, like providing security to Capx Cloud.

* **Vaults and Operator Registries**: Operators register once in Symbiotic’s OperatorRegistry and can then serve multiple networks. Vaults serve as stake pools, holding collateral and enforcing withdrawal and epoch rules.

* **Resolvers for Dispute Resolution**: Should conflicts arise over slashing incidents, resolvers—neutral arbitration entities—step in to ensure fairness, reducing the likelihood of arbitrary or malicious penalties.

## Symbiotic Components
The Symbiotic protocol introduces three key components that are essential for the operation and security of Capx Cloud:

    These are the staking pools where operators deposit their collateral. They enforce rules for withdrawals and epochs, ensuring that the staked assets are managed securely and transparently.

    These are the individuals or entities that provide the infrastructure for Capx Cloud. They register once in the Symbiotic OperatorRegistry and can then serve multiple networks, enhancing their operational efficiency.

    These are neutral arbitration entities that step in to resolve disputes, particularly in cases of slashing incidents. They ensure that penalties are fair and not arbitrary or malicious.
