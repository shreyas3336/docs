Operators are the custodians of the Capx Cloud network, managing the infrastructure that keeps everything running smoothly. Their responsibilities extend across multiple layers of the network, ensuring the stability, scalability, and security of decentralized services. Operators play a crucial role in maintaining node uptime, managing upgrades, and safeguarding the infrastructure against threats. 

They are not merely random nodes; they are vetted entities who:
* **Opt into Vaults and Networks**: After registration, operators must opt into specific vaults to gain access to staked collateral and into particular networks (like Capx Cloud) to become eligible for task allocations. Through this process, operators signal where they want to provide their services and under what economic terms.

* **Performance Tracking**: Every operator’s performance—**uptime, compliance with SLAs, correctness of task execution**—is continuously monitored. Operators that maintain exceptional standards enjoy higher trust, better task allocation opportunities, and greater financial rewards.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Infrastructure Management:** Operators oversee the setup, configuration, and maintenance of nodes, ensuring optimal performance and minimal downtime.
*   **Security Enforcement:** They implement security protocols to protect nodes from threats and ensure data integrity.
*   **Governance Participation:** Operators engage in the network's governance processes, contributing to decision-making on protocol upgrades, policy changes, and other critical matters.

Through the Symbiotic protocol, operators can accept stakes from diverse partners via unified vaults. This system enables operators to run a single infrastructure for multiple stakeholders without the complexity of separate setups. By doing so, operators improve resource efficiency while broadening access to network services for stakers and users alike.

## Types of Operator Nodes
Operators can run different types of nodes, each serving a unique purpose within the Capx Cloud ecosystem. The main types include:
