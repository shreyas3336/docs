These nodes form the foundation of the decentralized infrastructure, ensuring tasks are processed efficiently, reliably, and at scale. Their role is vital for supporting AI-driven applications and other AI-based operations.

When a user submits a task—such as running an AI model, processing data, or performing complex calculations—the Performer Node undertakes the execution.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Task Execution:** Upon receiving a task, the Performer Node utilizes its computational resources to process and complete the task efficiently.
*   **Proof of Task Generation:** After completing the task, the node generates a cryptographic proof, known as the Proof of Task, which serves as verifiable evidence of the task's execution.
*   **Result Dissemination:** The Performer Node then broadcasts the task results and the Proof of Task to the network, ensuring transparency and enabling subsequent validation.

**Importance in the Network:**

The efficiency and reliability of Performer Nodes are crucial, as they directly impact the network's ability to handle complex computations and deliver timely results to users. Performer Nodes regularly communicate with other components in the Capx Cloud, particularly Attestor Nodes, to ensure the integrity of their output. This continuous verification cycle establishes trust and minimizes the risk of fraudulent or incorrect task execution.
