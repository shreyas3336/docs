They serve as arbiters, handling disputes and overseeing slashing incidents—penalties imposed for malicious or faulty behavior when a Performer Node fails to meet task execution standards. Resolvers provide an impartial mechanism for reviewing these incidents to ensure that penalties are applied fairly and in accordance with network policies.

**Key Responsibilities:**

*   **Dispute Resolution:** Resolvers review conflicts arising from task executions, validations, or other network activities, providing impartial judgments.
*   **Slashing Oversight:** They assess slashing incidents to confirm that penalties are warranted and executed fairly.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Resolvers ensure that all actions taken within the network adhere to established rules and guidelines, maintaining fairness and transparency.

Resolvers operate under predefined agreements between networks and vaults. Depending on the network’s risk tolerance, multiple resolvers may collaborate to reach a consensus before approving or vetoing a slashing event. This arrangement provides additional security guarantees for stakeholders, as decisions are made transparently and through a decentralized process.

**Importance in the Network:**

By providing a structured mechanism for dispute resolution and penalty enforcement, Resolvers uphold the network. Allowing for flexible, scalable governance structures tailored to the needs of different protocols within the Capx Cloud ecosystem.
