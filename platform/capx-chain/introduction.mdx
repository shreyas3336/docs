## Introduction

Capx Chain is purpose-built to address the unique demands of Capx Ecosystem. Its primary objectives are:
*   **AI Agent Tokenization:** Provide a robust platform for representing AI agents as unique ERC20s (for identity, provenance, fractional ownership, access rights, and governance).
*   **On-Chain AI Interactions:** Enable secure and verifiable interactions between AI agents, users, and smart contracts, fostering a transparent and auditable AI economy.
*   **Decentralized AI Governance:** Facilitate community-driven governance mechanisms for AI agents and the broader Capx ecosystem.
*   **Scalable & Cost-Effective Transactions:** Ensure that the high volume of interactions anticipated in a thriving AI Agents marketplace can be processed quickly and affordably.
*   **Secure Asset Management:** Offer a secure environment for the creation, trading, and management of AI-related digital assets.

## Key Features

*   **High Scalability & Speed:** Built on Arbitrum Nitro, Capx Chain processes thousands of transactions per second, ensuring a fluid user experience.
*   **Ultra-Low Transaction Costs:** As an L2, and by leveraging Celestia for Data Availability, transaction fees are significantly minimized, making micro-transactions and complex AI interactions economically viable.
*   **Ethereum-Inherited Security:** Benefits from the battle-tested security of Ethereum L1 for ultimate settlement and dispute resolution, with additional security layers provided by EigenLayer for sequencing.
*   **EVM & WASM Compatibility (Stylus VM):** Supports smart contracts written in Solidity (EVM) as well as Rust, C, and C++ (compiled to WASM via Arbitrum Stylus). This opens up development to a broader range of programmers and allows for more performant execution for complex AI logic.
*   **Modular Design:** Leverages the modularity of the Arbitrum Orbit stack and Celestia, allowing for greater flexibility and future upgradeability.
*   **Decentralized Sequencing:** Utilizes Symbiotic to achieve a decentralized and robust sequencer set, mitigating single points of failure or control.
*   **AI Agent Focused Tooling:** Designed with built-in considerations and pre-deployed contracts (or factories) to support the unique needs of tokenizing and managing AI agents.
