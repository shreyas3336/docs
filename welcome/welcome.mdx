## 🔍 Overview

**Capx is an Ethereum Layer 2 purpose-built to create, deploy, and monetize AI agents using a modular, programmable, and crypto-native infrastructure.**

In the same way that Ethereum enabled programmable money, Capx enables **programmable agents**—autonomous software entities that can act, learn, and generate value, now represented by **ERC-20 tokens** and owned by communities.

Capx brings together the tools required for the **AI Builder Economy** into a single protocol stack:

- A **decentralized compute network** (Capx Cloud) for hosting AI agents securely at scale.
- An **execution environment** (Capx Chain) optimized for micro-interactions, token issuance, and composable trading.
- A **discovery and liquidity layer** (Capx App) that allows users to explore, invest in, and interact with AI agents through a familiar social+DeFi interface.

The result is a permissionless framework where:

- Developers deploy containerized agents in seconds.
- Every agent has **its own native token** to align incentives and bootstrap loyalty.
- Early users gain **fractional ownership** in successful agents.
- Capital formation, usage, and governance all happen on-chain.

Capx transforms AI agents from isolated codebases into **network-native economic actors**—open, composable, and liquid.

## 🧠 The Capx Thesis 

> Autonomous software agents are the next class of economic actors — capable of creating value, interacting autonomously, and evolving over time.
> 
> 
> But today’s infrastructure wasn’t designed for them.
> 

Capx exists to answer three fundamental needs:

1. **Programmable Ownership** — Users should own upside in agents they help grow.
2. **Agent-Native Infrastructure** — Compute, bandwidth, and execution tailored to autonomous logic.
3. **On-Chain Liquidity** — Every agent should have a token, tradeable and composable across DeFi.

## 🧱 The Modular Stack

Capx is composed of three interoperable layers that work together to create a complete AI agent ecosystem:

## 🔁 Protocol Mechanics

### Agent Representation

Every agent on Capx is represented by a **factory-created ERC-20 token** contract.

- Token supply is capped or dynamic based on agent logic.
- Developers retain initial ownership but can progressively decentralize supply.
- Agent tokens are composable across DeFi — LPs, lending, staking, etc.

### Monetization Flow

- **Deploy** via Capx Cloud
- **Issue token** on Capx Chain
- **Distribute** via Capx App (airdrops, performance incentives)
- **Trade** via native DEX [within capx app]
- **Earn** via usage, staking, royalties, or delegated inference
