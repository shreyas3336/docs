For tokenized AI agents to become a truly liquid asset class, a dedicated, efficient, and deeply integrated trading infrastructure is indispensable. The Capx ecosystem provides this through its native **Decentralized Exchange (DEX) & Liquidity Engine**, a purpose-built automated market maker (AMM) operating directly on Capx Chain. This AMM is an optimized fork of the battle-tested **Uniswap V2 protocol**, tailored to the specific requirements of the AI agent token economy.

### Architectural Foundation: Uniswap V2 Core Principles

Leveraging Uniswap V2 as the foundational codebase provides immediate access to its proven strengths:

*   **Constant Product Formula (`x * y = k`):** The core AMM logic ensures deterministic pricing based on the ratio of reserves in a liquidity pool.
*   **Permissionless Liquidity Provision:** Enables any user to contribute assets to liquidity pools and earn a proportional share of trading fees.
*   **Decentralized & Non-Custodial Trading:** Users retain full custody of their assets throughout the trading process, interacting directly with smart contracts.
*   **Robustness & Security:** Benefits from the extensive auditing and real-world resilience demonstrated by Uniswap V2.

However, the Capx DEX is not a generic fork; it incorporates specific design choices optimized for the agent token lifecycle.

## Uniswap V2 Core Interfaces

Before delving into Capx-specific extensions, here are the canonical Uniswap V2 interfaces that underpin all AMM operations.

### Factory Contract Interface

```solidity
interface IUniswapV2Factory {
    event PairCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, address pair, uint);

    function getPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external view returns (address pair);
    function allPairs(uint) external view returns (address pair);
    function allPairsLength() external view returns (uint);
    function feeTo() external view returns (address);
    function feeToSetter() external view returns (address);

    function createPair(address tokenA, address tokenB) external returns (address pair);
}
```

*Governance of pool registry and protocol-fees; deploys new pair via `createPair(tokenA, tokenB)`.*

### Pair Contract Interface

```solidity
interface IUniswapV2Pair {
    event Mint(address indexed sender, uint amount0, uint amount1);
    event Burn(address indexed sender, uint amount0, uint amount1, address indexed to);
    event Swap(address indexed sender, uint amount0In, uint amount1In, uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address indexed to);
    event Sync(uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1);

    function getReserves() external view returns (uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1, uint32 blockTimestampLast);
    function mint(address to) external returns (uint liquidity);
    function burn(address to) external returns (uint amount0, uint amount1);
    function swap(uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data) external;
    function skim(address to) external;
    function sync() external;
}
```

*Core pool mechanics: `mint()`, `burn()`, `swap()`, `sync()`, and reserve queries.*

### Router Contracts

```solidity
// Core swap + liquidity (Router01)
function addLiquidity(
    address tokenA, address tokenB,
    uint amountADesired, uint amountBDesired,
    uint amountAMin, uint amountBMin,
    address to, uint deadline
) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB, uint liquidity);

function removeLiquidity(
    address tokenA, address tokenB,
    uint liquidity, uint amountAMin, uint amountBMin,
    address to, uint deadline
) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB);

function swapExactTokensForTokens(
    uint amountIn, uint amountOutMin,
    address[] calldata path,
    address to, uint deadline
) external returns (uint[] memory amounts);

// Permit-enabled + fee-on-transfer variants (Router02)
function removeLiquidityWithPermit(
    address tokenA, address tokenB, uint liquidity,
    uint amountAMin, uint amountBMin,
    address to, uint deadline,
    bool approveMax, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s
) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB);

function swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
    uint amountIn, uint amountOutMin,
    address[] calldata path,
    address to, uint deadline
) external;
```

*User-facing entry points: multi-hop swaps, liquidity management, permit and fee-on-transfer support.*

### Library Helpers

```solidity
function getAmountsOut(address factory, uint amountIn, address[] memory path)
    internal view returns (uint[] memory amounts);

function getAmountsIn(address factory, uint amountOut, address[] memory path)
    internal view returns (uint[] memory amounts);
```

*On-chain price/amount calculations by reading pair reserves along a path.*

## Strategic Optimizations for the Agent Economy

1.  **Universal Base Pair: $CAPX:**
    *   **Liquidity Concentration:** All AI agent tokens are exclusively paired against the Capx ecosystem's native utility token, **$CAPX** (e.g., `AgentTokenA/$CAPX`, `AgentTokenB/$CAPX`). This contrasts with general-purpose DEXs that allow arbitrary pairings.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Simplified UX:** Users only need to hold $CAPX to interact with any agent token market.
        *   **Improved Price Stability:** Concentrating liquidity against a common base asset generally leads to deeper markets and reduced slippage for agent tokens, especially for newly launched agents.
        *   **Efficient Routing:** Simplifies multi-hop swap calculations if ever needed, though direct $CAPX pairs are the primary design.
        *   **Strengthened CAPX Utility:** Enhances the demand and utility of the $CAPX token as the primary gateway to the agent economy.

2.  **Isolated Liquidity Pools per Agent:**
    *   Each AI agent token, upon creation and registration, has the capability to have its own dedicated `AgentTokenX/$CAPX` liquidity pool contract deployed.
    *   This isolation prevents a "rug pull" in one agent's pool from directly impacting the liquidity or integrity of another agent's distinct pool, though systemic risks via $CAPX volatility remain a general market factor.

3.  **Gas Efficiency on Capx Chain (L2):**
    *   Operating on Capx Chain (an L2 leveraging Arbitrum Nitro) inherently means Uniswap V2 operations (swaps, liquidity additions/removals) are significantly cheaper and faster than on Ethereum L1. This is crucial for fostering active trading of potentially lower-value or early-stage agent tokens.

4.  **Deep SuperApp Integration:**
    *   The Capx SuperApp provides a seamless front-end for interacting with the DEX. Users can swap tokens, view pool statistics, and (in future phases) manage liquidity positions directly within the agent's profile or a dedicated DEX interface in the app, abstracting away direct smart contract interactions for most users.

## Core DEX Operations & Smart Contracts

*   **Factory Contract (Uniswap V2 Factory):**
    *   Responsible for deploying new unique `AgentTokenX/$CAPX` pair contracts (liquidity pools).
    *   Maintains a registry of all created pairs.
    *   Only permits pair creation with $CAPX as one of the assets and a verified agent token (from the Capx Token Registry) as the other.
*   **Pair Contracts (Uniswap V2 Pair):**
    *   Each `AgentTokenX/$CAPX` pool is its own smart contract.
    *   Holds reserves of the two tokens.
    *   Implements the `swap()`, `mint()` (for adding liquidity), and `burn()` (for removing liquidity) functions.
    *   Emits `Sync` and `Swap` events crucial for off-chain price tracking and analytics.
*   **Router Contract (Uniswap V2 Router):**
    *   Provides user-friendly functions to interact with pair contracts (e.g., `swapExactTokensForTokens`, `addLiquidity`).
    *   Handles the necessary token transfers and calculations, abstracting complexity from the end-user or dApp integrator.
    *   Enforces deadlines and slippage protection parameters for swaps.

### **The Swap Execution Flow (Simplified):**

1.  **User Initiates Swap (via SuperApp):** User intends to swap `amountIn` of $CAPX for `AgentTokenX`.
2.  **Router Interaction:** SuperApp crafts a transaction calling a function like `swapExactCAPXForTokens(amountIn, amountOutMin, path, to, deadline)` on the Capx DEX Router contract.
    *   `path`: Will be `[$CAPX_address, $AgentTokenX_address]`.
3.  **Token Transfer & Pair Call:** The Router pulls `amountIn` of CAPX from the user, then calls the `swap()` function on the specific `AgentTokenX/$CAPX` pair contract.
4.  **Pair Contract Logic:**
    *   The pair contract calculates the `amountOut` of `AgentTokenX` based on current reserves and the constant product formula, accounting for a 0.3% trading fee (standard Uniswap V2, potentially configurable for Capx).
    *   It transfers `amountOut` of `AgentTokenX` to the user and updates its internal reserves.
    *   Emits `Swap` and `Sync` events.
5.  **Transaction Finality:** The L2 transaction is confirmed rapidly on Capx Chain.

## Liquidity Provision & Incentives (Roadmap)

While initial liquidity may be seeded programmatically or by developers/Capx Treasury, the long-term health of the agent token markets will depend on community liquidity provision.

*   **Current State:** Users can trade. LP management features are typically rolled out progressively.
*   **Future LP Features:**
    *   **SuperApp LP Interface:** Tools within the SuperApp to add/remove liquidity to `AgentTokenX/$CAPX` pairs.
    *   **LP Token (ERC-20):** When users add liquidity, they receive LP tokens representing their proportional share of the pool. These LP tokens can themselves be staked or used in other DeFi protocols.
    *   **Fee Accrual:** LPs earn 0.3% (or the configured percentage) of all trading volume in their respective pools, proportional to their share.
    *   **Advanced Analytics:** Dashboards displaying LP PnL, impermanent loss estimations, fee generation, and share of pool.
    *   **Protocol-Level Incentives:** Potential for distributing additional $CAPX rewards or other incentives to LPs in strategic agent token pools to bootstrap liquidity (often referred to as "liquidity mining").

## Security & On-Chain Oracle Potential

*   **Audited Base & Controlled Modifications:** The security heavily relies on the proven Uniswap V2 contracts, with any Capx-specific modifications undergoing rigorous auditing.
*   **Token Whitelisting via Registry:** The DEX interacts only with agent tokens verified by the Capx Token Registry, minimizing the risk of scam tokens in native pools.
*   **On-Chain Price Feeds (TWAP Oracles):** Uniswap V2 pair contracts can serve as on-chain price oracles by providing time-weighted average prices (TWAPs). This allows other smart contracts on Capx Chain to securely query the recent historical price of an agent token against $CAPX, enabling more advanced financial applications and agent logic based on token value.
