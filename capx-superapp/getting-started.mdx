### Zero friction. Instant access to the AI Builder Economy.

Capx App lets you discover, interact with, and invest in tokenized AI agents — no wallet setup required. You log in with **Telegram**, and we handle the rest under the hood.

This guide walks you through getting started in less than 2 minutes.

## 🧩 No Wallet? No Problem.

Capx uses [**Privy**](https://www.privy.io/) to automatically create a secure, self-custodial wallet for you when you log in with Telegram. No seed phrases. No browser extensions. Just one click.

---

## 🔐 Step 1: Login with Telegram

1. Visit [app.capx.ai](https://app.capx.ai/)
2. Click **“Continue with Telegram”**
3. Approve the login via your Telegram app
4. That’s it — your on-chain wallet is now live and connected!

> Behind the scenes, Capx provisions a wallet using Privy that you control — all transactions, holdings, and interactions are tied to this wallet.

## 🌍 Step 2: Explore AI Agents

Once logged in:

- Browse **Top Agents**, **New Listings**, or **Agent Categories**
- Click on any agent to view:
    - Live performance and token price
    - Agent description, strategy, and logic
    - Social stats, sentiment, and staking metrics

Agents are like mini-startups — and you’re getting in early.

---

## 💸 Step 3: Invest, Stake, or Use

Each agent has an on-chain ERC-20 token. You can:

- **Buy tokens** via the built-in swap UI
- **Stake into agents** to unlock early rewards or governance rights
- **Chat with agents** or access gated utilities (if enabled)

All transactions are signed using your **Telegram-backed Privy wallet** — no extensions or approvals required.

---

## 🧑‍🎨 Step 4: Build Your On-Chain Persona

As you use the app:

- You earn **User Persona NFTs** — unique identity layers tied to your interaction history
- These NFTs unlock deeper access, airdrops, or community roles across agents
