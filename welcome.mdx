## üîç Overview

**Capx is an Ethereum Layer 2 purpose-built to create, deploy, and monetize AI agents using a modular, programmable, and crypto-native infrastructure.**

In the same way that Ethereum enabled programmable money, Capx enables **programmable agents**‚Äîautonomous software entities that can act, learn, and generate value, now represented by **ERC-20 tokens** and owned by communities.

Capx brings together the tools required for the **AI Builder Economy** into a single protocol stack:

- A **decentralized compute network** (Capx Cloud) for hosting AI agents securely at scale.
- An **execution environment** (Capx Chain) optimized for micro-interactions, token issuance, and composable trading.
- A **discovery and liquidity layer** (Capx App) that allows users to explore, invest in, and interact with AI agents through a familiar social\+DeFi interface.

The result is a permissionless framework where:

- Developers deploy containerized agents in seconds.
- Every agent has **its own native token** to align incentives and bootstrap loyalty.
- Early users gain **fractional ownership** in successful agents.
- Capital formation, usage, and governance all happen on-chain.

Capx transforms AI agents from isolated codebases into **network-native economic actors**‚Äîopen, composable, and liquid.

## üß† The Capx Thesis

> Autonomous software agents are about to become the most important economic actors of the next decade. They can think, act, and iterate faster than any human-run startup ‚Äî but the current web-3 stack was built for people, not code that writes its own rules.

Capx closes that gap by solving three first-principle problems:

| What Agents Need                | Why It Matters                                                                                                                                                                 | How Capx Delivers                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Programmable Ownership**      | Early users, data providers, and contributors deserve a direct stake in the agents they power. Without shared upside, network effects stall.                                   | Every agent launches with a native ERC-20 token. Distribution schedules bake in community ownership from day one, aligning incentives as the agent scales.                              |
| **Agent-Native Infrastructure** | Conventional clouds throttle long-running, self-reflexive processes. Agents need deterministic compute, cheap micro-transactions, and bandwidth designed for autonomous logic. | **Capx Cloud** and **Capx Chain** form a vertically integrated runway for nonstop agent execution.                                                                                      |
| **On-Chain Liquidity**          | Tokens are only useful if they can move. Agents must plug into existing DeFi rails for price discovery, collateral, and composability.                                         | Built-in AMM pools let every agent token trade instantly. Liquidity hooks feed into the broader DeFi stack, making agent assets borrowable, LP-able, and legible to any smart contract. |

**In one sentence:** Capx is the programmable ownership, execution, and liquidity layer that lets autonomous agents graduate from proof-of-concept demos to fully capitalized, community-owned businesses.

## üß± The Modular Stack

Capx is composed of three interoperable layers that work together to create a complete AI agent ecosystem:
