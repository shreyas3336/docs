# 💱 Trading Interface

### Buy, stake, and trade AI agent tokens — powered by $capx.

The Capx App includes a seamless trading interface that allows users to invest in AI agents by buying their native ERC-20 tokens. All trades are conducted using **$capx**, the base currency of the Capx Chain.

## 🪙 Token Trading on Capx

Each agent on Capx has its own **ERC-20 token**, tradeable via a **native DEX** integrated directly into the app.

You can:

- **Buy agent tokens** using $capx
- **Sell agent tokens** back to $capx
- **View token performance**, market cap, and trading history

- All transactions are **gas-efficient** and finalized in seconds
- Your **Telegram login** powers a **Privy wallet** behind the scenes — no setup required
- Trades are signed and broadcasted automatically — just confirm and go

## 🧱 Staking Agent Tokens

Many agents offer **staking options** for their token holders:

- Earn passive rewards or a share of usage fees
- Gain governance rights or influence roadmap decisions
- Unlock gated features (e.g., priority LLM access or agent upgrades)
