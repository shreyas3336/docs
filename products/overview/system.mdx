* **Capx Chain (Ethereum L2)**: Anchored to Ethereum for security, running smart contracts, managing tokens, governance, operator registries, and AI agent logic.

* **Symbiotic Integration**: Capx Cloud leverages Symbioticâ€™s vaults and operator registries for secure restaking and operator onboarding.

* **Off-Chain Operators**: Capx Cloud orchestrates a decentralized network of trusted operators leveraging existing cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP). Providers connect their environments, execute tasks, and submit verifiable proofs, ensuring computational integrity.


### Key Actors

1. **Users:**
    *   **Agent Users:** These users interact with AI agents through the Capx SuperApp. They are the primary consumers of the AI services provided on the platform.
    *   **Token Holders:** These users hold and utilize $CAPX tokens, participating in the economic and governance aspects of the Capx ecosystem.
2. **Developers:**
    *   **Agent Developers:** These developers are responsible for creating and deploying the AI agents that power the Capx Cloud.
    *   **Application Developers:** They build applications that leverage the Capx SuperApp and integrate with the deployed AI agents.
3. **Operators:**
    *   **Compute Provider:** Operators contribute essential computing resources, such as CPU, memory, and GPU, to the network. They are responsible for executing the AI agent workloads.
    *   **Restaker:** Operators also function as restakers, staking collateral through the Symbiotic protocol to ensure the security and trustworthiness of the network.
4. **Capx SuperApp:** The SuperApp acts as the central interface for users to interact with AI Agents as well as trade & own the tokenized AI Agents & Apps.
5. **Capx Chain:** This is the foundational blockchain infrastructure that enables secure and transparent transactions within the Capx ecosystem. It handles key operations like AI agent tokenisation, resource allocation, and reward distribution.
6. **Symbiotic:** Symbiotic is the restaking protocol integrated into Capx Cloud. It plays a critical role in maintaining network security by managing the (re)staking and potential slashing of operator collateral.

### Interactions

*   **User-SuperApp Interaction:** Users interact with the Capx SuperApp to access and utilize AI agents.
*   **Developer-SuperApp/Capx Cloud Interaction:** Developers use the SuperApp or interact directly with the Capx Cloud to deploy their AI agents.
*   **Operator-Network Interaction:** Operators provide compute resources to the network and execute AI agent workloads.
*   **Operator-Symbiotic Interaction:** Operators engage with Symbiotic for restaking purposes, contributing to network security.
*   **SuperApp-Chain Interaction:** The Capx SuperApp interacts with the Capx Chain to facilitate AI agent tokenisation and onchain ownership-trading transactions.
*   **Chain-Ecosystem Interaction:** The Capx Chain serves as the backbone for all on-chain transactions and interactions within the Capx ecosystem.
