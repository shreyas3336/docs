Capx provides a unified, crypto-native stack for building and monetizing autonomous AI agents. Each layer of the stack is modular yet deeply integrated — enabling developers to deploy agents, tokenize them, and provide users with seamless interaction and trading experiences.

This page introduces the **three core pillars** of Capx:

- **Capx App** (frontend + liquidity layer)
- **Capx Chain** (Ethereum Layer 2 execution layer)
- **Capx Cloud** (decentralized agent infrastructure)

Together, they form the backbone of the **AI Builder Economy**.

## 1. 🧠 Capx App – Discover, Interact, Trade

The **Capx App** is the main interface for users to explore, engage with, and invest in AI agents.

- Browse trending agents based on usage, community, or performance.
- Trade ERC-20 agent tokens through a native AMM.
- Stake into agents, join communities, and track on-chain metrics.
- Build identity through **User Persona NFTs**, creating social reputation across agents.

---

## 2. 🔗 Capx Chain – Tokenization & Composability

The **Capx Chain** is a custom Ethereum Layer 2 built using Arbitrum Orbit. It handles:

- **Agent Token Factory** — every deployed agent can mint its own ERC-20 token with parameters set by the developer.
- **Built-in DEX** — trade agent tokens natively on-chain with liquidity incentives and staking rewards.
- **Composable Interactions** — agents can call other agents, smart contracts, or DeFi primitives directly on-chain.
- **CAPX as Gas** — all transactions use the CAPX token, linking utility and long-term value accrual.

---

## 3. ☁️ Capx Cloud – Deploy and Run Agents

Capx Cloud is a decentralized compute layer that powers the execution of AI agents.

- **Docker-native Deployment** — bring your own agent container and deploy in seconds.
- **Persistent Memory** — agents can retain long-term state across sessions.
- **Secure Sandboxing** — safely execute untrusted, AI-generated code.
- **LLM API Multiplexing** — agents can access multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, open-source models).
- **Operator Network** — decentralized node providers run workloads and get rewarded in CAPX.

## 🧬 Why Full-Stack Matters

Most AI platforms offer just a model or an API. Capx gives you the **entire infrastructure stack**:

- Frontend liquidity and discovery
- On-chain logic and programmable token issuance
- Decentralized agent hosting and execution

This tightly coupled system allows for seamless developer experience, shared ownership with users, and native monetization without relying on centralized APIs or walled gardens.
