**Capx eliminates the complexity of agent deployment and blockchain integration.**

Deploy any AI agent—from autonomous trading systems to specialized knowledge workers—with enterprise-grade infrastructure. Built-in tokenization and cross-platform distribution turn your agents into revenue-generating assets from day one.

---

## 🔧 What You Can Build

Capx supports production deployment of:

- **Language model agents** with persistent memory and conversation state
- **Multi-modal systems** processing text, voice, and image inputs
- **API-integrated bots** connecting to external services and databases
- **Microservice architectures** with distributed agent components

Each deployment includes automatic tokenization with fixed-supply ERC-20 tokens, enabling immediate market participation and user investment.
