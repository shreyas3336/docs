## What is a Capx Operator?

Capx Operators are the custodians of the Capx Cloud network, playing a pivotal role in managing the infrastructure that ensures the smooth and efficient operation of decentralized services. Their responsibilities are multifaceted, spanning multiple layers of the network to guarantee stability, scalability, and security.

Operators are not just anonymous nodes within the system; they are vetted entities committed to the network's health. 

## Operator Role

The role of a Capx Cloud Operator comes with a significant set of responsibilities, which are directly linked to the opportunities and incentives offered by the network.
