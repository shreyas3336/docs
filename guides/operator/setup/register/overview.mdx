The Capx Cloud network relies on trusted operators to maintain infrastructure integrity and ensure reliable AI agent execution. As an operator, you'll be responsible for running nodes that facilitate agent execution, validation, and consensus within the network. Becoming an operator in the Capx Cloud network is a strategic opportunity to participate in a decentralized AI infrastructure while earning rewards.

## Before You Begin

Before starting the registration process, ensure you have:

1. Created a wallet that will be associated with your operator identity
2. Acquired the necessary tokens for staking (different amounts for Testnet vs. Mainnet)
