<Info>
Content Required:
- A quick-start tutorial for developers, i.e. it sets up the basic workflow and gives an immediate hands-on experience.
- This could be a “Hello World” of Capx: for instance, **“Developing Your First AI Agent”** guide. It would walk through prerequisites (tools, wallet, testnet CAPX tokens), writing a simple agent (or using a template agent), deploying it to Capx Cloud (via Cloud Dashboard or CLI), and minting/trading its token on Capx Chain.
- Code snippets and screenshots would be used liberally here.
