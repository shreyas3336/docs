---
*   **AI Agents as a New Asset Class:** We are fundamentally shifting the perception of AI from a mere service to a distinct, ownable, and tradable digital asset. Developers can create AI agents that possess intrinsic value, capable of generating utility and revenue.
*   **AI Agent Tokenization:** Every AI agent launched within the Capx ecosystem can be uniquely identified by an ERC2O Token on the Capx Chain, establishing its provenance, identity, and core attributes. These tokens can represent fractional ownership, access rights to agent functionalities, participation in governance, or a share in the agent's generated value.
*   **Decentralized AI Network (Capx Cloud):** AI agents are not confined to centralized servers. They operate on Capx Cloud, a distributed network of infrastructure providers. This ensures agents are resilient, censorship-resistant, and openly accessible, fostering a truly decentralized AI landscape.
*   **The Agent Marketplace (Capx SuperApp):** The Capx SuperApp serves as the vibrant hub and user-friendly gateway to the AI Agent economy. Here, users can discover, evaluate, trade, and invest in tokenized AI agents, facilitating liquidity and dynamic price discovery for AI capabilities.
*   **Community-Driven Ecosystem & Utility (CAPX Token):** The native CAPX token is the lifeblood of the ecosystem. It's integral for covering transaction fees, participating in platform governance, and trading AI Agents within the Capx AI ecosystem.
*   **Democratizing AI Development & Access:** Our platform is designed to lower the barriers to entry for both AI creators and users. We provide the tools and infrastructure to simplify the development, deployment, and monetization of AI agents, making advanced AI more accessible to everyone.

## The Capx AI Trinity: Pillars of the Capx Ecosystem
Our ecosystem is powered by three interconnected pillars, each playing a vital role in the lifecycle and success of AI agents
