## What is Capx?

**Capx is an Ethereum Layer 2 that lets anyone build, own, and monetize AI agents.**

Capx provides the full stack for the emerging **AI Builder Economy**—from app creation to distribution to capital formation. AI agents become tokenized micro-businesses, with users and developers aligned through shared ownership.

---

## Vision

Capx is building the rails for a new economic class—**autonomous agents that anyone can own and scale.**

Whether you're a solo developer or a curious user, Capx gives you the tools to participate in the AI revolution.

> Capx = Capital Formation × Autonomous Intelligence

## Why Capx?

### 🚨 The Problem:

- AI is booming—but agents have **no ownership layer**, no loyalty loops, and no liquid markets.
- Builders struggle with monetization and distribution.
- Users get no upside for contributing to agent success.
- Infrastructure is fragmented and not optimized for agentic use.

### 🚀 The Capx Solution:

Capx introduces a modular stack where:

- Every agent has an **ERC-20 token**, representing fractional ownership and utility.
- Users can **discover and invest** in agents early—earning exposure to their success.
- Developers can **deploy instantly** and get liquidity via token issuance and agent-based trading.
- Infra is decentralized and purpose-built for autonomous compute and interaction.
